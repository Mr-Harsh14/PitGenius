# PitGenius Model Implementation Results
## Overview
We implemented three different machine learning models to predict pit stop occurrences in Formula 1 races using data from the 2022 season. The models were trained to predict the binary classification problem of whether a pit stop would occur (`has_pit_stop`).

## Data Characteristics
- **Dataset**: 2022 F1 Season
- **Class Distribution**:
  - No Pit Stop (Class 0): 4,468 instances
  - Pit Stop (Class 1): 152 instances
- **Features**: Combination of temporal, performance, and race-specific metrics

## Model Performance Summary

### 1. Random Forest Model
**Best Performance Metrics**:
- F1 Score: 0.682
- Precision: 0.57 (pit stops), 0.99 (no pit stops)
