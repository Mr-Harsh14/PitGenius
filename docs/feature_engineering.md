# Feature Engineering Documentation

## Overview
This document details the feature engineering process implemented in PitGenius for Formula 1 pit stop prediction. The process involves transforming raw race data into meaningful features that capture the complex dynamics of F1 racing and pit stop strategies.

## Data Sources
- FastF1 API: Primary source for lap-by-lap telemetry data
- Ergast API: Additional race information and historical data

## Feature Categories

### 1. Temporal Features
#### Lap Time Features
- `LapTime_seconds`: Total lap time in seconds
- `PrevLap_Time_seconds`: Previous lap time
- `Rolling_Avg_Time`: 3-lap rolling average time
- `Delta_Last_Lap`: Time difference from last lap

#### Sector Times
- `Sector{1,2,3}_Time_seconds`: Individual sector times
- `Sector{1,2,3}_Delta`: Sector time differences from previous lap
- `Best_Sector{1,2,3}`: Boolean indicating if it's the driver's best sector

#### Session Progress
- `LapNumber`: Current lap number
- `RemainingLaps`: Laps remaining in race
- `SessionTime_seconds`: Time since race start
- `RaceCompletion_Percentage`: Percentage of race completed

### 2. Performance Metrics
#### Speed Measurements
- `SpeedI1`: Speed at intermediate point 1
- `SpeedI2`: Speed at intermediate point 2

- `AverageSpeed`: Average lap speed

#### Tire Performance
- `TyreLife`: Number of laps on current tire set
- `TyreDegradation`: Estimated tire wear percentage
- `CompoundAge`: Laps on current compound type
- `ExpectedTyreLife`: Expected total life of current compound

#### Position and Progress
- `Position`: Current race position
- `PositionChange`: Position changes in last 3 laps
- `GapToLeader`: Time gap to race leader
- `GapToAhead`: Time gap to car ahead
- `QualyPosition`: Starting grid position

### 3. Categorical Features
#### Team and Driver
- `Team`: Constructor team (one-hot encoded)
- `Driver`: Driver identifier (one-hot encoded)
- `TeammateGap`: Gap to teammate
- `ConstructorPoints`: Team's championship points

#### Tire Information
- `Compound`: Current tire compound (one-hot encoded)
- `PreviousCompound`: Previous tire compound
- `OptimalCompoundLife`: Manufacturer's optimal life for compound

### 4. Engineered Compound Features
#### Strategy Indicators
- `PitWindow`: Boolean indicating if within optimal pit window
- `UndercutThreat`: Risk of being undercut by competitors
- `OvercutOpportunity`: Potential for overcut strategy
- `StrategyOffset`: Lap offset from expected pit window

#### Performance Trends
- `TyrePerformanceTrend`: Rolling average of lap time changes
- `SectorPerformanceDecay`: Degradation in sector times
- `RelativePerformance`: Performance vs. similar tire age

## Feature Processing

### 1. Data Cleaning
- Handling missing values through forward fill or interpolation
- Removing outliers using IQR method
- Standardizing time formats and units

### 2. Feature Transformation
#### Numerical Features
- Standard scaling for all time-based features
- Min-max scaling for position-based features
- Log transformation for highly skewed distributions

#### Categorical Features
- One-hot encoding for team and driver
- Label encoding for ordinal features
- Feature hashing for high-cardinality categories

### 3. Feature Selection
#### Importance Analysis
- Random Forest feature importance ranking
- Correlation analysis for feature redundancy
- LASSO regularization for feature selection

#### Dimensionality Reduction
- PCA for feature compression
- Feature agglomeration for related metrics
- Removal of highly correlated features

## Feature Validation

### 1. Quality Checks
- Missing value percentage < 1%
- Feature correlation thresholds
- Variance inflation factor analysis

### 2. Performance Impact
- Individual feature contribution to model performance
- Feature group importance analysis
- Cross-validation stability metrics
